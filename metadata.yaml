description: "Castle Rackrent, a short novel by Maria Edgeworth published in 1800,\
  \ is often regarded as the first historical novel, the first regional novel in English,\
  \ the first Anglo-Irish novel, the first Big House novel and the first saga novel.\n\
  It is also widely regarded as the first novel to use the device of a narrator who\
  \ is both unreliable and an observer of, rather than a player in, the actions he\
  \ chronicles. Kirkpatrick suggests that it \"both borrows from and originates a\
  \ variety of literary genres and subgenres without neatly fitting into any one of\
  \ them\". William Butler Yeats pronounced Castle Rackrent \"one of the most inspired\
  \ chronicles written in English\".\nShortly before its publication, an introduction,\
  \ glossary and footnotes, written in the voice of an English narrator, were added\
  \ to the original text to blunt the negative impact the Edgeworths feared the book\
  \ might have on English enthusiasm for the Act of Union 1800.\nThe novel is one\
  \ of the few of Edgeworth's novels which her father did not 'edit'.\n From Wikipedia\
